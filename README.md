ion_freenet
===========

A Desktop Application to use free internet in the hostel over the ION network .
Exploited a bug in the service that allowed any number of users to use same internet account by just using the same ip-address.
So the app looks for the appropriate working IP, executes CMD commands to set the ip and checks the connection by pinging a website .
Anyways the bug is fixed now. But it was worth learning executing shell commands from a Qt app and using VB script.
